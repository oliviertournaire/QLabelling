# _QLabellingArrangement_

_QLabellingArrangement_ is a simple GUI to label images. It was initially developed to label fa√ßade images for training algorithms. Since version 1.2.0 (see Versions notes below), _QLabellingArrangement_ is based on CGAL::Arrangement_2 for faces definitions and is thus not anymore restricted to label axis-aligned objects.
