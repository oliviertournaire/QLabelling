* Save a labels image with associated information (labels' colors, input and label images) in a raw ASCII file <image_label_filename>.labels
* Dynamic labels: you must defines labels names and colors in a separate text file. See files rc/labels_facade_simple.txt or rc/labels_facade_enhanced.txt for examples. **Note that you always must to define a label named _unknow_ (case sensitive)!**
